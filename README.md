# 🚀 LeetCode DSA Progress Tracker  

This repository tracks my progress in solving **LeetCode Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems**.  
The problems are categorized into topics. Currently, I’ve solved a few and added them here — this will be a continuously growing space where I’ll keep adding more solutions and patterns as I progress. 📂✨  

Confused about where to start in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**?  
I faced the same thing at the beginning.  

Here is the **structured roadmap of 70 essential LeetCode problems**.  
These questions cover the most important patterns.  

The strategy is clear — **master the art of recognizing patterns, and problem-solving becomes much easier with the right approach.**  

This repository is both my **personal progress tracker** and a **guide for anyone** who wants to build strong DSA foundations.

## 📌 Prerequisites  

Before jumping into these problems, here are a couple of things that helped me:  

1. **The 2-Minute Rule to Learn Coding** – [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25RdTDN2Trg&list=WL&index=2)  
   > A simple mindset hack that helps you stay consistent while learning coding.  

2. **Getting Your Fundamentals Ready (Master DSA)** – [Watch here](https://youtu.be/J0OvDNmAWNw?si=Cu7d7sVhgH3rm5QD)  
   > Strong basics are the foundation of mastering DSA. This video will help you prepare.
